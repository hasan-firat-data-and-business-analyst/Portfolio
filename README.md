### My Python Journey

This is my personal extensive studying about data science on Python

Data Science Python

Description

A collection of data science scripts for data analysis in Python. Please also see my related repository Python Machine Learning which contains many implementations of Machine Learning algorithms including regression, classification, and clustering. The algorithms are implemented in two ways: from scratch in Python and using Scikit Learn functions.

Python libraries used:
Numpy
Scipy
Scikit Learn
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
